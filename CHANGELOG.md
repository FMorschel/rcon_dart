## 1.2.0

* Replaced the Flutter dependency with a meta dependency. The declaration of the annotations is in that package.

## 1.1.0

* Refactored basically every function and split them into many more functions.
* Added a whole lot of comments to go with that refactoring.
* Also added DartDocs to the new functions (but those are all private... so you may never see them :P)
* Modified the example.dart to reflect the new API.
* Modified the README getting started section.
* Modified the README usage section.
* Added Flutter dependency (required for function annotations).
* Added unit tests. THESE ARE NOT DONE. I AM NOT GOING TO WRITE MORE. AT LEAST NOT RIGHT NOW. I DO NOT HAVE THE WILLPOWER TO DO THIS ANY LONGER. Please send help.

## 1.0.3

* Something funky happened with the upload of the last version. Trying again...

## 1.0.2

* Actually renamed the example file...

## 1.0.1

* Fixed example Dart file name to match pub.dev requirement. (This was a lie.)
* Removed Flutter dependency.

## 1.0.0

* Fixed some debug print lines. Tested package and full API is operational.

## 0.0.2

* Fixed a typo in the README.

## 0.0.1

* Implementation of the RCON protocol. Contains full API.
